DQL (Data Query Language) – Using SELECT in SQL
🧩 What is DQL?

DQL (Data Query Language) is used to retrieve data from a database.
The main command used is SELECT.

⚙️ 1️⃣ Basic SELECT

Get all columns from a table:

SELECT * FROM customer;


Get specific columns:

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer;

⚙️ 2️⃣ Using WHERE Clause (Filtering Data)

Filter rows based on a condition:

SELECT * FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > 3.0;


With multiple conditions:

SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE active = 1 AND store_id = 1;

⚙️ 3️⃣ Using Comparison Operators
Operator	Meaning	Example
=	Equal to	WHERE rating = 'PG'
<> or !=	Not equal	WHERE rating != 'R'
>	Greater than	WHERE rental_rate > 2.0
<	Less than	WHERE length < 120
>=	Greater or equal	WHERE rental_rate >= 4.0
<=	Less or equal	WHERE length <= 90

Example:

SELECT title, rental_rate FROM film
WHERE rental_rate >= 4.0;

⚙️ 4️⃣ Using BETWEEN Operator

To select data between two values:

SELECT title, length FROM film
WHERE length BETWEEN 90 AND 120;

⚙️ 5️⃣ Using IN Operator

To match multiple possible values:

SELECT * FROM film
WHERE rating IN ('PG', 'PG-13', 'R');

⚙️ 6️⃣ Using LIKE Operator

For pattern matching:

-- Title starts with 'A'
SELECT title FROM film
WHERE title LIKE 'A%';

-- Title ends with 's'
SELECT title FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%s';

-- Title contains 'LOVE'
SELECT title FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%LOVE%';

⚙️ 7️⃣ Using IS NULL / IS NOT NULL

Check for missing or available values:

SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE email IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE email IS NOT NULL;

⚙️ 8️⃣ Sorting Results (ORDER BY)

Sort the query output:

SELECT title, rental_rate, length
FROM film
ORDER BY rental_rate DESC, length DESC;

⚙️ 9️⃣ Removing Duplicates (DISTINCT)

Get unique values:

SELECT DISTINCT rating FROM film;

⚙️ 🔟 Limiting Results (LIMIT)

Limit the number of rows returned:

SELECT * FROM film
LIMIT 5;

⚙️ 11️⃣ Aliases (AS Keyword)

Rename columns for readability:

SELECT first_name AS 'Customer First Name', last_name AS 'Customer Last Name'
FROM customer;

⚙️ 12️⃣ Concatenation

Combine multiple columns:

SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM customer;

⚙️ 13️⃣ Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions summarize data.
Common ones: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX().

🧮 Examples:

COUNT()

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers FROM customer;


SUM()

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_payment FROM payment;


AVG()

SELECT AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rental_rate FROM film;


MIN() / MAX()

SELECT MIN(length) AS shortest_film, MAX(length) AS longest_film FROM film;

⚙️ 14️⃣ GROUP BY

Used with aggregate functions to group results.

-- Number of films by rating
SELECT rating, COUNT(film_id) AS film_count
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;

-- Total amount per customer
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id;

⚙️ 15️⃣ HAVING Clause

HAVING is like WHERE, but used after aggregation.

-- Customers who paid more than $100 total
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 100;

-- Ratings with more than 200 films
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS total_films
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
HAVING COUNT(*) > 200;

🧾 Summary Table
Concept	Keyword	Example
Retrieve all data	SELECT *	SELECT * FROM film;
Filter rows	WHERE	WHERE rental_rate > 3.0
Pattern match	LIKE	title LIKE '%ACTION%'
Range filter	BETWEEN	length BETWEEN 90 AND 120
Group data	GROUP BY	GROUP BY rating
Filter grouped data	HAVING	HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
Sort results	ORDER BY	ORDER BY rental_rate DESC
Remove duplicates	DISTINCT	SELECT DISTINCT rating
Limit rows	LIMIT	LIMIT 5
Aggregate	COUNT(), SUM()	SUM(amount)
